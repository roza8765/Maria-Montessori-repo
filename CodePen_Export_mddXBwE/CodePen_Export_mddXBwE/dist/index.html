     <ul id="list">
  <li> born on August 31, 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy</li>
       <li>In 1883 at the age of 13, Montessori entered a secondary, technical school, Regia Scuola Tecnica Michelangelo Buonarroti, where she studied Italian, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, accounting, history, geography, and sciences. She graduated in 1886 with good grades and examination results.</li>
       <li>in 1890, she enrolled in the University of Rome in a degree course in natural sciences, passing examinations in botany, zoology, experimental physics, histology, anatomy, as well as general and organic chemistry, and earning her diploma di licenza in 1892. This degree, along with additional studies in Italian and Latin, qualified her for entrance into the medical program at the University in 1893.</li>
       <li>In 1898, she wrote several articles and spoke again at the First Pedagogical Conference of Turin, urging the creation of special classes and institutions for mentally disabled children, as well as teacher training for their instructors.</li>
       <li>In 1899 Montessori was appointed a councilor to the newly formed National League for the Protection of Retarded Children, and was invited to lecture on special methods of education for retarded children at the teacher training school of the College of Rome.</li>
       <li>In 1903 and 1904, she conducted anthropological research with Italian schoolchildren and in 1904 she was qualified as a free lecturer in anthropology for the University of Rome.</li>

      <li>In 1909, Montessori held the first teacher training course in her new method in Citt√† di Castello, Italy. In the same year, she described her observations and methods in a book titled (The Method of Scientific Pedagogy Applied to the Education of Children in the Children's Houses).</li>
    <li>In 1919 she resigned from her position at the University of Rome, as her educational work was increasingly absorbing all her time and interest.</li>
    <li>In 1949 the first training course for birth to three years of age, called (Montessori School for Assistants to Infancy) was established. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Montessori was also awarded the French Legion of Honor, Officer of the Dutch Order of Orange Nassau, and received an Honorary Doctorate of the University of Amsterdam.</li>
